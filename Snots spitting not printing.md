Wel if u see 3d printer like making snots or spitting and stops extruding filament from nozzle then its time to clean nozzle or change it.

For this preheat it and unscrew it. 
Then you can heat it on candle and try ti clean with special needle or u can try to waporize all with torch). Be careful some uburned particles can make obstructions even worse.
You also can throw the nozzle in hot water with lemon acid (can be bought in grocery store in powder) afterwards. It will become shiny.

Also it can be obstruction between heater and teflon tube. There must be no space between nozzle an teflon tube, if it is, then liquid plastic will harden in radiator and cloge plasic tread.
